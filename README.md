# Shun4miShu
Discord bot 海嘯翔海 (Tsunami in Chinese + My Japanese name Shu), which deals with Chinese input in Zhuyin/Pinyin, and possible autocorrection with Zhuyin.

# Pronunciation
Please just pronounce it in English as "Shunami Shu", or in Chinese as the characters 海嘯翔海 directly. If you ever try to pronounce this in another language, you must have too much time in your life, so go touch some grass :)

## How do I touch grass?
1. Open your terminal
2. Type in
```cmd
touch grass
```
3. If you use VSCode, type in
```cmd
code grass
```
4. Now you have a lot of grass to flaunt to your non-coder friends about touching ~~and make them think you've never been out of the house in days~~
